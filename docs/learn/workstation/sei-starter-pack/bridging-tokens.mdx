# Bridging Tokens 

This section is for Sei users who want to bridge liquidity from other chains to the Sei network. 

Bridging liquidity from other chains is made simple with Sei. This tutorial utilizes the official Sei bridge, https://app.sei.io/bridge, which facilitates transfers to and from multiple chains, including;

- Ethereum
- Solana
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- BNB Smart Chain
- Osmosis
- Optimism

### Step 1: Navigate to the Official Sei Bridge Page

Begin by visiting the Sei bridge at https://app.sei.io/bridge

### Step 7: Inputting the Receiving Address

To expedite the process, click the "Autofill" button. This will automatically populate the destination address field with the correct information. If you're using a different wallet besides Compass, you can simply paste in your receiving address without connecting to the bridge.
