Navigating the world of decentralized finance can sometimes feel daunting. This section is equipped to guide you step-by-step on getting started with Sei and Astroport. 

### 1. Getting $SEI to Start Transacting

In order to perform any transaction on the Sei network, you will need to hold some $SEI for gas. There are currently two primary ways to obtain $SEI:

- Sei Airdrop and Rewards: Check if you qualify for the Sei airdrop or Sei rewards by visiting [app.sei.io](https://app.sei.io/).
- Centralized Exchanges: Purchase $SEI from leading centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. After acquiring $SEI, you can withdraw them directly to a Sei network address. If you're new and don't have a Sei wallet yet, our first tutorial can guide you through creating one.

### 2. Bridging Tokens

Leverage the [Sei bridge](https://app.sei.io/bridge) to seamlessly transfer stables from multiple networks:

- **USDC**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana 
- **USDT**: BNB Smart Chain 
- **axlUSDC**: ETH, Arbitrum, Polygon, and BNB Smart Chain
