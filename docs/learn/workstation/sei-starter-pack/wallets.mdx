### Step 3: Save Your Secret Recovery Phrase

A unique secret recovery phrase will be generated for you. It's essential to keep this phrase in a secure and private location, as it is the only way to recover your wallet should you forget your password or lose access. 

Once you have stored it safely, select "I have saved it somewhere safe" to move on.

### Step 4: Confirm Your Secret Recovery Phrase

To ensure that you have accurately saved your recovery phrase, you'll be asked to fill in the missing three words in the sequence. This step is crucial to confirm that you have noted down your phrase correctly.
