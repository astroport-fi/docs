After you select the Terra Station extension for the first time, you will be given an option to either create a new wallet or import an existing wallet. For this tutorial, we will be creating a new wallet. 

### Step 5: Write down your Seed Phrase

Choose a name and password for your wallet. Note your password down in a safe place as this will be required to log in to your wallet interface. If you lose your password, you can retrieve your wallet by importing your seed phrase. 

Write the 24-word seed phrase down in a secure and private place and in the proper order.

<Admonition type="danger" title="Important Note"> 
Losing the seed phrase will lead to loss of the funds kept in the wallet. Do not share your seed phrase with anyone.

Once you've written down your seed phrase, click on "Next".
