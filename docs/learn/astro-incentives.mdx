# Astro Incentives

Liquidity providers (LPs) can provide liquidity to a large number of platforms, which may offer drastically different rewards and fees. Astroport addresses this problem with its permissionless incentives system, which allows anyone to add incentives to any pool on any of Astroport's outposts.

## Liquidity Mining​

Rather than depositing Astroport LP tokens directly in third-party staking contracts, LPs can deposit their tokens into Astroport’s incentives contract to start receiving rewards.

When an LP wishes to claim accrued rewards, they can claim those rewards from Astroport's Reward Center.

More information is available under the [Deploying Incentives](./workstation/incentives/incentives-intro) section.
