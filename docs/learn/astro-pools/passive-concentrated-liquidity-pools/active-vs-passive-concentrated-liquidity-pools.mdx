# Active vs Passive Concentrated Liquidity Pools

Both Uniswap and Curve introduced novel concentrated liquidity models, but they each cater to different types of assets and trading preferences. Uniswap's concentrated liquidity model requires active management by liquidity providers (LPs). 

On the other hand, passive concentrated liquidity automates the management of price ranges. LPs don't need to actively manage their price ranges, as the model relies on automated strategies to handle price range adjustments. This reduces complexity and allows for a more hands-off experience for LPs.
