# Emissions Voting (vxASTRO)

The vxASTRO contract enables xASTRO token holders to stake their tokens and participate in Emissions Voting.

## Features

• **Indefinite Locking:** Tokens are locked indefinitely, with an option for users to request unlocking at any time.
• **Unlocking Period:** The unlocking process takes 14 days.
• **Voting Power:** vxASTRO voting power is always equivalent to the underlying xASTRO share.
• **Governance:** vxASTRO holders retain their voting power in Astroport Governance while their xASTRO is locked.
• **Non-Transferable:** vxASTRO tokens are not transferable.
• **CW20 Queries:** The contract implements several CW20 queries to function like a CW20 token for query purposes, useful for wallet views.
• **Emissions Controller Interaction:** The contract interacts with the Emissions Controller whenever a user's balance changes, updating the user's contribution in Emissions Voting.

The Emissions Controller allows vxASTRO holders to vote on ASTRO emissions. This Hub's contract is responsible for collecting votes from vxASTRO stakers from all outposts and calculating the final ASTRO emissions every epoch.
