# Overview

The $ASTRO token lies at the heart of the Astroport ecosystem, helping coordinate and align incentives of all stakeholders involved. Ultimately, Astroport is designed to become a digital commons that is owned, controlled, operated, maintained, and updated by the community of its users and builders.

As a token, $ASTRO is designed to be the tool for distributing the value of and power over the Astroport smart contract system.

The goal is to make the user a space station ‘owner’ that maintains and improves Astroport.
