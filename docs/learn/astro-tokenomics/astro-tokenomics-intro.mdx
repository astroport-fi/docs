# Astro Tokenomics

The ASTRO token on Terra 2 and ASTROC on Terra Classic lie at the heart of the Astroport ecosystem, helping coordinate and align incentives of all stakeholders involved. Ultimately, Astroport is a digital commons that is owned, controlled, operated, maintained, and updated by the community of its users and builders.

As a token, ASTRO and ASTROC are designed to be the tools for distributing the value of and power over the Astroport smart contract system on their respective blockchains (Terra 2 and Terra Classic).

The goal is to make the user a space station ‘owner’ who maintains and improves Astroport.
