# Brand Kit

Astroport hovers among the stars, an intergalactic trading port that belongs to the only people who matter… its users and builders.

In the spirit of this radical decentralization, all aspects of Astroport must belong to the community… from the smart contract code to Astroport’s logo and brand itself.

Astroport's branding policy is intended to empower you, the community, to get creative with it. Take the Astroport logo and put it on t-shirts, hats, and tungsten cubes. Or make it look even cooler — it’s all up to you.
Starting now, all assets will be available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Check out all the details below, or dive into our graphics files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TA_3ZU32CDJ6pdYmfdMVp_TxJpzW7RoU). Let’s build the galaxy’s best DEX together.

## Astroport Brand Policy

The Astroport name, marks, dress, logos and brand, including the name “Astroport”, were created by the joint venture of Astroport builders. A complete set of such intellectual property created by the Astroport builders is available at the [Astroport Design Kit here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TA_3ZU32CDJ6pdYmfdMVp_TxJpzW7RoU) (collectively, the **“Astroport Designs”**).

The Astroport Designs are not trademarks or service marks and are not intended to identify the source of any goods or services. They constitute part of the ownerless, decentralized Astroport commons, which is governed through a combination of rough social consensus and the on-chain governance processes of the Astral Assembly.
Accordingly, to whatever extent the Company possesses intellectual property rights in the Astroport Designs, the Company hereby licenses all such rights to the public under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) (the “License”) Among other things, the License entails that you may, subject to the conditions set forth in the License:

- reproduce and “Share” (as defined in the License) the Astroport Designs, in whole or in part; and
- produce, reproduce and Share any Adapted Material (as defined in the License, which includes material that is derived from or based on the Astroport Designs).

The License conditions include:

- attributing the Astroport Designs and any Adapted Material to the Company and the creators of the Adapted Material; and
- adding the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License to any Adapted Material (which means that the Adapted Work will be licensed to the public on the same terms as the Astroport Designs).
