## Disclaimers

***Authorship.*** *These documents and information (the “Repository”) have been authored by the joint venture developing the Astroport technologies (such joint venture and each of its participants, the “Astroport Joint Venture”).*

***Informational Purposes Only; No Warranties.*** *The Repository is only a presentation of information regarding certain technologies. The statements contained in the Repository do not provide any advice, representation, warranty, certification, guarantee or promise relating to these technologies, any uses thereof or any of the other matters discussed in the Repository, nor does the Repository provide an offer or agreement to make such technologies available, maintain or update such technologies, or sell or buy any asset or enter into any transaction. You should not rely on the Repository as a basis for making any financial or other decision.*

***No Governmental/Regulatory Review or Approval.*** *The Repository and the matters described in the Repository have not been reviewed, approved, endorsed or registered with any regulator or other governmental entity, and the authors of the Repository are not licensed by any regulator or other authority to provide any legal, financial, accounting, investment or other advice or services.*

***Uncertain Nature of Forward-Looking Statements; No Duty to Update.*** *The forward-looking statements in the Repository are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and thus the events described or predicted therein are subject to change or to fail to occur in accordance therewith. We undertake no obligation to update, supplement or amend any statement that becomes inaccurate or incomplete after the date on which the Repository is first published, or to alert the public as to any such inaccuracy or incompleteness, whether such inaccuracy or incompleteness arises as a result of new information we receive, changes of our plans, unanticipated events or otherwise.*

***Experimental Technology.*** *The technologies and assets described in the Repository are highly experimental and risky, have uncertain and potentially volatile value, and should be directly evaluated by experts in blockchain technologies before use. Use them solely at your own risk.*
 
***No Ongoing Management.*** *Consistent with the goals of community governance described in the Repository, after the public launch of Astroport, the Astroport Joint Venture and its members and service providers should not be expected to have a material ongoing role in Astroport maintenance, research, development or promotion. The Astroport Joint Venture and its members have not dedicated capital specifically to future Astroport development and have no plans to raise capital dedicated specifically to Astroport maintenance or development. The Astroport Joint Venture will not continue as a joint venture after the public launch of Astroport.*

***Builder ASTRO Allocations & Lack of Ongoing Governance and Management.*** *The Astroport Joint Venture is not making any representation, promise, guarantee or assurance that any ASTRO granted to its members or service providers, or any funding or resources of the members, will be held, used or spent for the benefit of the Astroport community. Any sale or other transfer or distribution of ASTRO tokens by the Astroport Joint Venture or its members or service providers could occur without warning. Any such transaction would increase the circulating supply of ASTRO tokens. Depending on the number of ASTRO sold, transferred or distributed, the terms of sale, transfer or distribution and the prevailing market conditions, such a sale, transfer or other distribution could have a material adverse effect on the price or value of, or demand for, ASTRO tokens.*

*The members of the Astroport Joint Venture and their service providers will hold a substantial amount of ASTRO. Any use of such ASTRO to vote in the Astral Assembly could affect governance outcomes. The members and service providers of the Astroport Joint Venture are not promising to participate or to refrain from participating in Astroport governance, whether by voting ASTRO, xASTRO or vxASTRO or otherwise. The Astroport Joint Venture and its members and service providers are not promising that, if any of them do participate in Astroport governance, they will vote in any particular way, observe any standard of care or act in the best interests of Astroport users, ASTRO holders or any other persons. The Astroport Joint Venture or its members or service providers could have financial interests or other interests or incentives which could outweigh their respective interests and incentives (if any) relating to Astroport.*

*Members and service providers of the Astroport Joint Venture who hold ASTRO and choose to participate in governance will be required to use their own personal independent discretion and decision-making in doing so. The Astroport Joint Venture and its members will not direct, manage or control how its members and service providers participate in Astroport governance. As a result of the foregoing factors and the lack of any person or group of persons able to control and manage Astroport, any discretionary decision-making related to Astroport depends on the effectiveness of spontaneous group decision-making among participating ASTRO, xASTRO and vxASTRO holders. There may be disputes, differences of opinion, disagreements, conflicting incentives and a lack of extrinsic coordination among or between any or all governance participants, and such circumstances may adversely affect governance results.*
