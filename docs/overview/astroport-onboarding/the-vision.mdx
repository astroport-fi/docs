# The Vision

Astroport's vision is to become the prevailing next-generation AMM with deep liquidity pools and significant trading volumes for the Cosmos ecosystem. Better pricing will allow Astroport to attract more liquidity, leading to a self-reinforcing loop. Ultimately, Astroport aims to operate as Cosmos's underlying liquidity layer:

- Integrating liquidity mining programs for new Cosmos tokens including those that adopt dual rewards
- Generating key data/oracle prices for other projects, including credit protocols like Mars
- Serving as the backbone for index products or baskets of tokens
- Supplying liquidity to wallets and trading aggregators that access liquidity from multiple DEXes
- Serving as the underlying liquidity layer for yield farming protocols

There’s even the possibility that users on other chains or dApps could access Astroport liquidity without needing even realizing they’re using Astroport.
