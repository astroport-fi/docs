{/* - [**`factory:`**](./factory) Creates new Astroport pair contracts (and associated LP token contracts) which are tracked in a registry and used as a directory for all pairs. 
- [**`constant_product_pools:`**](./swap-pairs/constant-product-pools) Uses the widely known xy=k formula.
- [**`stableswap_pools:`**](./swap-pairs/stableswap-pools) Uses the 4A(Rx+Ry) + D formula, resulting in a constant price ∆x / ∆y = 1.
- [**`oracle:`**](./oracle) Calculates a 1 day TWAP for an xy=k Astroport pool.
- [**`router:`**](./router) Contains logic to facilitate multi-hop swaps for Cosmos native & CW20 tokens.
- [**`token:`**](./token) Implementation for the ASTRO token.
- [**`generator:`**](./tokenomics/generator) Allocates token rewards (ASTRO) for various LP tokens and distributes them pro-rata to LPs. 
- [**`generator_proxy:`**](./tokenomics/generator-proxy) Allows an external staking contract to be connected to the Generator to offer a second reward besides ASTRO token emissions.
- [**`maker:`**](./tokenomics/maker) Collects part of Astroport's pair fees (according to the factory's `maker_fee`).
- [**`staking:`**](./tokenomics/staking)  Allows ASTRO holders to stake their tokens in exchange for xASTRO.
- [**`vesting:`**](./tokenomics/vesting) Progressively unlocks ASTRO that can then be distributed to LPs via the Generator contract.
- [**`xastro_token:`**](./tokenomics/xastro-token) ASTRO token implementation.
- [**`astral_assembly:`**](./astral-assembly) Allows xASTRO holders as well as Initial Astroport Builders to post and vote on new on-chain proposals that can execute arbitrary logic. */}
