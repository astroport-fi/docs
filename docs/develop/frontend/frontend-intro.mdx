# Frontend

## Docker

Anyone can run the Astroport User Interface (UI) in Docker. Docker images for the frontend can be found in the [official Astroport GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/astroport-fi/packages).

### Getting Started

Before you start, make sure that you have Docker installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

### Steps to Run the Astroport UI in Docker

#### Pull the Docker Image

Open your terminal and use the following command to pull the Astroport UI Docker image:

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

        ```bash 
        docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/astroport-fi/<repository>/<package>:<tag>
        ```

    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

Make sure to replace `repository`, `package`, and `tag` with the correct repository name, package name, and the version tag respectively.

#### Run the Docker Image

Once the Docker image has been pulled successfully, run the image using the following command:

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

        ```bash 
        docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/astroport-fi/<repository>/<package>:<tag>
        ```

    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

This command runs the Docker image and maps the application which is running on port 80 inside the Docker container to port 8000 on your host machine.

Now, you can open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see the Astroport UI running.

Remember to replace placeholders (`repository`, `package`, and `tag`) with the actual values. You may need to check the exact usage of Docker commands depending on the configuration of your Docker image.
