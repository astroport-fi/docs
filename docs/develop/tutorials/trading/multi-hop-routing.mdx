# Multi-hop Routing

## Overview

There are some cases where liquidity between a pair may be low or not exist and you need to perform a multi-hop swap between two or more pairs. The [`Router` contract ](../../smart-contracts/router) enables multi-hop swap operations for Cosmos native and CW20 tokens. Swaps execute one-by-one and the last swap will return the ask token. 

The initial swap will contain the offer token which determines how the contract message gets proccessed by the `Router` contract. If the offer token is a native token, we can send an `ExecuteMsg` to the `Router` contract directly. Otherwise (if it's a CW20 token), we will need to encode our message within a `Cw20ExecuteMsg` that gets sent from the address of the token we are swapping. 

## Native Routing

Use when the initial offer asset is a Cosmos native token.

        ### `execute_swap_operations`

        To create a native multi-hop swap, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the `execute_swap_operations` endpoint in the [`Router`](../../smart-contracts/router) contract

        `operations` is the only required parameter and holds information regarding each swap stored in a vector containing objects of type [`SwapOperation`](../../smart-contracts/router#swapoperation).

        <Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
            [`SwapOperation`](../../smart-contracts/router#swapoperation) is a helper enum that filters between `astro_swaps` and `native_swaps`. The former gets processed as swaps through Astroport's liquidity pools and the latter gets swapped natively (only between native assets). 

            This should not be confused with [Native Routing](#nativerouting). Our initial offer asset in this section is still a native asset despite our swap being an `astro_swap`. As an `astro_swap`, we are simply swapping between a native and CW20 token through an Astroport liquidity pool.

        #### `Coins`

        Since our initial offer token is a native asset, we need to send the native token along with the transaction message.

        The code in this section is an example of what a complete swap message may look like using [feather.js](../network/terra-2#featherjs) to send Coins with our transaction.

        ```js focus=1:40,44:59
        // testnet contract addresses
        const routerAddress = 'terra1na348k6rvwxje9jj6ftpsapfeyaejxjeq6tuzdmzysps20l6z23smnlv64';

        const nativeRouterSwap = new MsgExecuteContract(
        wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
        routerAddress,

                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ], 
                "minimum_receive": beliefPrice,
                "max_spread": "0.005",

        }, 
        new Coins({ "uluna": "100000" })
        )

        const fee = new Fee(2000000, { uluna: 200000 });

        // // BROADCAST TRANSACTION
        const tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({
            msgs: [nativeRouterSwap],
            fee,

        console.log(result);
        ```

        ---

        ### Optional Parameters

        The `execute_swap_operations` endpoint takes in the following optional parameters:

        - `minimum_receive`: Minimum expected return amount
        - `max_spread`: The difference between the ask amount before and after the swap. If the swap spread exceeds the provided max limit, the swap will fail.
        - `to`: Address receiving tokens (if different from sender)

        ```json focus=33:35
        {
            "execute_swap_operations": {
                "operations": [
                    {
                        "astro_swap": {
                            "offer_asset_info": {
                                "native_token": {
                                    "denom": "uluna"
                                }
                            },
                            "ask_asset_info": {
                                "token": {
                                    "contract_addr": usdcAddress
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }, 
                    {
                        "astro_swap": {
                            "offer_asset_info": {
                                "token": {
                                    "contract_addr": usdcAddress
                                }
                            },
                            "ask_asset_info": {
                                "token": {
                                    "contract_addr": zeroAddress
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ], 
                "minimum_receive": beliefPrice,
                "max_spread": "0.005",
                "to": "..."
            }
        }
        ```
        ---

        #### `minimum_receive` + `max_spread`

        If `minimum_receive` is provided in combination with `max_spread`, the pool will check the difference between the return amount (using `belief_price`) and the real pool price.

        `minimum_receive` +/- the `max_spread` is the range of possible acceptable prices for this swap.

        ```json focus=33:34
        ```

        ---

        ### Calculating `minimum_receive`

        Astroport's native solution to obtain `minimum_receive` is to query the [`simulate_swap_operations`](../../smart-contracts/router#simulate_swap_operations) endpoint from the [`Router`](../../smart-contracts/router) contract and to pass the result of this query into the swap message. 

        ```json focus=33
        ```

        ---

        #### `simulate_swap_operations`

        The [`simulate_swap_operations`](../../smart-contracts/router#simulate_swap_operations) endpoint takes in two parameters: 

        - `offer_amount`: The amount of tokens to swap
        - `operations`: The swap operations to perform

        The `operations` parameter takes in the same vector of [`SwapOperation`](../../smart-contracts/router#swapoperation) objects that our swap message contains. 

        ```js
        {
            "simulate_swap_operations": {
                "offer_amount": "100000",
                "operations": [
                    {

                                }

                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }, 
                    {

## CW20 Routing

Use when the initial offer asset is a CW20 token.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Scrollycoding>

        ### `Cw20HookMsg`

        To perform a CW20 swap, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the [`send`](https://docs.rs/cw20/latest/cw20/enum.Cw20ExecuteMsg.html#variant.Send) endpoint in the CW20 contract of the token you are swapping.

        `send` includes the contract the tokens are being sent to (router contract), the amount to send/swap, and a binary encoded msg containing our contract call.

        ```json 
        {
            "send": {
                "contract": routerAddress, 
                "amount": "1000000",

        #### `execute_swap_operations`

        Our encoded swap message performs a contract call to the [`execute_swap_operations`](#execute_swap_operations) endpoint in the `Router` contract. This is the same operation covered above in [Native Routing](#native-routing).

        ```json focus=6:41
        ```

        ---

        ### Encoding our `Msg`

        To encode our message, there are two common options:

        - An [online base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/)
        - A custom function
        
        The code in this section uses a custom function (`toBase64`) to display our binary message - this function needs to be defined elsewhere to be used. The actual string representation of our message would be an encoded binary.

        ```json focus=5:42
        ```

        ---

        #### `toBase64` Encoder

        The code in this section is an example of what a `send` message may look like [feather.js](../network/terra-2#featherjs) to define our custom function and encode our message.

        ```js
        const toBase64 = (obj) => {
            return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)).toString("base64");
        };

        const cw20RouterSwap = new MsgExecuteContract(
            wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
            astroAddress,
            {
                "send": {
                    "contract": routerAddress, 
                    "amount": "1000000",

        ### Calculating `minimum_receive`

        Lastly, calculating `minimum_receive` for CW20 swaps is the exact same as it is for native swaps. 

        Note that since we are performing a CW20 swap, our initial offer asset is a CW20 token and not a native asset like `uluna`, but the logic remains the same. To learn more about this topic, refer to the section [above](#calculating-minimum_receive).

        ```json
        {
            "simulate_swap_operations": {
            "offer_amount": "1000000",
                "operations": [
                    {
                        "astro_swap": {

                                "token": {
                                    "contract_addr": astroAddress
                                }
                            },
                            "ask_asset_info": {
                                "native_token": {
                                    "denom": "uluna"
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }, 
                    {
                        "astro_swap": {
                            "offer_asset_info": {

                                }

                            "ask_asset_info": {
                                "token": {

                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
