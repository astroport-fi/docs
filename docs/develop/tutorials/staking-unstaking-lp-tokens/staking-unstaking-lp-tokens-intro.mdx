# Staking/Unstaking LP Tokens

You can stake your LP tokens into the [Generator contract](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator) to receive ASTRO and/or 3rd party rewards by calling the [`deposit`](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#deposit) endpoint. 

You can unstake your LP tokens by calling [`withdraw`](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#withdraw) endpoint in the Generator contract. `withdraw` also claims any outstanding token rewards.

The sections below are dedicated to guiding users through the process of staking and unstaking LP tokens in the Generator contract to receive ASTRO and/or third-party rewards.

## Staking LP Tokens

### 1. Construct `send` message

Initiate a contract message pointing to the [`send`](https://docs.rs/cw20/latest/cw20/enum.Cw20ExecuteMsg.html#variant.Send) endpoint of the LP token contract that you want to stake. The `send` operation requires three parameters:

- **`contract`:** This refers to the address where the LP tokens are being dispatched. In this context, it should be the generator address.
- **`amount`:** This specifies the quantity of LP tokens to be sent or staked. 
- **`msg`:** This is a binary-encoded message that contains a contract call to the `deposit` endpoint. This message will be discussed below. 

<Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
    The `send` function should be executed from the contract of the LP token you want to stake.

    <CH.Code>

        ```json focus=1:5,9:11
        {
          "send": {
            "contract": generatorAddress, 
            "amount": "12345", 
            "msg": toBase64(
              {
                "deposit": {}
              }
            ) 
          }
        }
        ```

    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### 2. Construct `deposit` message

The `msg` parameter in Step 1 requires a binary-encoded message, which essentially includes a contract call to the [`deposit`](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#deposit) endpoint within the Generator contract. For this message, no other parameters are needed.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

        ```json focus=5:9
        {
          "send": {
            "contract": generatorAddress, 
            "amount": "12345", 
            "msg": toBase64(
              {
                "deposit": {}
              }
            ) 
          }
        }
        ```

    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### 3. Define an encoding function

Next, you'll need to encode the `deposit` message you've constructed. As previously outlined in Step 1, the `msg` parameter requires a binary-encoded string. In Step 2, we prepped our `deposit` message for encoding using a `toBase64` function. Now it's time to actually perform that encoding.

Please note that the `toBase64` function must be defined in your code environment to use it for encoding purposes. This function is crucial to convert the JSON string representation of our message into a base64 encoded string.

Here's an example of how to define the `toBase64` function in JavaScript:

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

        ```js
        let toBase64 = (obj) => {
          return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)).toString("base64");
        };
        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

## Unstaking LP Tokens

### 1. Construct `withdraw` message

When you are ready to unstake your LP tokens from the Generator contract, you can execute a contract call to the [`withdraw`](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#withdraw) endpoint within the [Generator contract](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator) itself.

The `withdraw` operation requires two parameters:
- **`lp_token`**: The address of the LP token that you want to withdraw.
- **`amount`**: The quantity of tokens you wish to unstake.

<Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
    You should replace `astroUSDCLPAddress` with the specific address of the LP token you wish to unstake. Each LP token has a unique contract address, so it's important to make sure you are using the correct one in your `withdraw` operation.

        ```json
        {
            "withdraw": {
                "lp_token": astroUSDCLPAddress,
                "amount": "5000000"
            }
        }
        ```
    </CH.Code>
