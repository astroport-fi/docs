# Dual Rewards

Astroport's Dual Rewards model offers a unique value proposition for Liquidity Providers (LPs) through the use of ASTRO Generators and proxy contracts. Proxy contracts route third-party token emissions to an ASTRO Generator, which then handle the dual distribution of both ASTRO and third-party tokens to Liquidity Providers (LPs). To learn more about Dual Rewards and ASTRO Generators, visit [here](../../../learn/astro-generators). 

To integrate Dual Rewards for a pool, there are a series of steps that developers will need to follow. These steps are designed to set up the distribution mechanism for third-party rewards, establish the proxy contract, and engage with Astroport's governance to finalize the integration. Here are the primary steps you'll need to follow:

1. [**Deploy a Liquidity Mining Mechanism:**](./deploying-a-liquidity-mining-mechanism) This mechanism is responsible for distributing your protocol's governance token to LPs in the Astroport pool and contains the logic for LP Token staking and reward distribution.
2. [**Deploy a Generator Proxy Contract:**](./deploying-a-generator-proxy-contract) This contract routes your protocol's token emissions to an ASTRO Generator.
3. [**Submit a Governance Proposal for Dual Rewards:**](./submitting-a-governance-proposal) This step involves proposing the integration to the Astroport community and getting their approval.

The following sections will provide a detailed walkthrough for each of these steps.
