# 2. Deploying a Generator Proxy Contract

**The second step towards integrating Dual Rewards for a pool is to deploy a [Generator Proxy contract](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator-proxy).** A Generator Proxy contract serves a specific and indispensable role: it directs your protocol's token emissions towards an ASTRO Generator, creating a pathway for distributing rewards to liquidity providers.

Furthermore, the generator proxy contract permits a connection between an external staking contract and the Generator. This is a key feature that allows stakers in the Generator to claim both ASTRO emissions and third-party tokens simultaneously. This process, known as "dual rewards" within the Astroport ecosystem, significantly enhances the potential earnings for LPs. 

Astroport simplifies the process of creating a Dual Rewards Proxy by providing a [customizable template](https://github.com/astroport-fi/astroport-core/tree/main/templates/generator_proxy_template). This template, created to assist you in deploying your own generator proxy contract, can be adapted to align with your liquidity mining mechanism and specific requirements of your Astroport pool. For those needing a hands-on demonstration, Astroport offers a fully implemented [proxy contract example](https://github.com/astroport-fi/astro-generator-proxy-contracts).
