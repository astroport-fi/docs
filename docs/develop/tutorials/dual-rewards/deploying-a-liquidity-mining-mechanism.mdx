# 1. Deploying a Liquidity Mining Mechanism

**The first step towards integrating Dual Rewards for a pool is deploying a Liquidity Mining Mechanism.** This mechanism is critical as it allows the distribution of your governance token to Liquidity Providers (LPs) and contains the logic for LP Token staking and reward distribution.

For emerging projects aiming for a seamless integration with Astroport, we recommend basing your liquidity mining contracts on established designs: 

1. The [Mirror design](https://github.com/Mirror-Protocol/mirror-contracts/tree/main/contracts/mirror_staking) offers a comprehensive framework. By adopting this design, you can leverage its robust infrastructure and avoid many of the complexities associated with developing a liquidity mining mechanism from scratch.
2. If you're seeking a simpler approach, [Anchorâ€™s liquidity mining mechanism](https://github.com/Anchor-Protocol/anchor-token-contracts/tree/main/contracts/staking) offers a less complex but equally reliable model. Adopting Anchor's mechanism should not require significant modifications to the proxy contract, making it a more streamlined option for some projects.

Both Mirror and Anchor designs offer tested frameworks to get you started, and you can adapt these designs to best serve your protocol's needs.
