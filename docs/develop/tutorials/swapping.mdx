# Swapping

## Overview 

The contract for a given pair allows anyone to perform a `swap` between two assets in a pool. Depending on the type of assets in the pair, a user could perform two types of swaps: 

- Native swap (Native -> Native / Native -> CW20)
- CW20 swap (CW20 -> CW20 / CW20 -> Native)

A native swap will interact with the pair contract directly while a CW20 swap will interact with the CW20 token contract and be processed by the `pair` contract as a `Cw20HookMsg`. 

## Native Swap

Performs a native swap in a given pool.

        ### `Swap` Endpoint

        To perform a native swap, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the [`swap`](../../develop/smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools#swap) endpoint in the [`pair` contract](../../develop/smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools) for a given pool.

        The `swap` endpoint requires an `offer_asset` parameter which contains information about the offer asset itself and the `amount` to send. 

        ```json focus=1:10,14:15
        {
            "swap": {
                "offer_asset": {
                    "info": {
                        "native_token": {
                            "denom": "uluna"
                        }
                    },
                    "amount": "100000"
                }, 
                "belief_price": beliefPrice, 
                "max_spread": '0.005', 
                "to": "..."
            }
        }
        ```

        ---

        #### `Coins`

        For native swaps, you need to send the `native_token` along with the transaction message.
        
        The code in this section is an example of what a `swap` message may look like using [feather.js](./tutorials-intro) to send `Coins` with our transaction. 

        ```js
        const astrolunaAddress = "terra1udsua9w6jljwxwgwsegvt6v657rg3ayfvemupnes7lrggd28s0wq7g8azm";

        const swap = new MsgExecuteContract(
            wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
            astrolunaAddress,
            {
                "swap": {
                    "offer_asset": {
                        "info": {
                            "native_token": {
                                "denom": "uluna"
                            }
                        },
                        "amount": "100000"
                    }
                }
            },
            new Coins({ uluna: '100000' })
        );

        const tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({
            msgs: [swap],
            feeDenoms: ['uluna'],
            chainID: 'pisco-1',
        });

        const result = await lcd.tx.broadcast(tx, 'pisco-1');

        console.log(result);
        ```

        ---

        ### Optional Parameters

        The `swap` endpoint takes in the following optional parameters:

        - `belief_price`: Expected return amount
        - `max_spread`: The difference between the ask amount before and after the swap operation. If the swap spread exceeds the provided max limit, the swap will fail. 
        - `to`: Address receiving tokens (if different from sender)

        ```json focus=11:13
        {
            "swap": {
                "offer_asset": {
                    "info": {
                        "native_token": {
                            "denom": "uluna"
                        }
                    },
                    "amount": "100000"
                }, 
                "belief_price": beliefPrice, 
                "max_spread": '0.005', 
                "to": "..."
            }
        }
        ```

        ---

        #### Belief Price + Max Spread

        If `belief_price` is provided in combination with `max_spread`, the pool will check the difference between the return amount (using `belief_price`) and the real pool price.

        The `belief_price` +/- the `max_spread` is the range of possible acceptable prices for this swap.

        ```json focus=11:12
        ```

        ---

        ### Calculating the `belief_price`

        To obtain the `belief_price`, this tutorial uses two examples: 

        - Calculating the `belief_price` using the proportion of pool balances
        - Querying the [`simulation`](../../develop/smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools#simulation) endpoint in the pair contract for which the swap is taking place


        ```json focus=11
        ```

        ---

        #### `Pool` Endpoint

        To calculate the `belief_price` using the proportion of pool balances, we first need to fetch the amount of each asset in the pool. This can be done by calling the [`pool`](../../develop/smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools#pool) endpoint in the pair contract. 

        {/* Once we have the amount of each asset in the pool. we can calculate the `belief_price` and input the result into our execute message.  */}

        The code in this section is an example of using [feather.js](./tutorials-intro) to query the pair contract, perform calculations with our response, and store the results in a variable to use as an input for our swap message.  

        {/* ```js
        const { assets } = await lcd.wasm.contractQuery(
            astrousdcAddress, 
            {  
                "pool": {}
            }
        );
        
        const beliefPrice = (
            assets[0].amount / assets[1].amount
        ).toFixed(18); 
        ``` */}

        ```js
        const astrolunaAddress = "terra1udsua9w6jljwxwgwsegvt6v657rg3ayfvemupnes7lrggd28s0wq7g8azm";
        const { assets } = await lcd.wasm.contractQuery(astrolunaAddress, { "pool": {} });
        const beliefPrice = (assets[0].amount / assets[1].amount).toFixed(18); 
        ```

        ---

        #### `Simulation` Enpoint

        Astroport's native solution for calculating the `belief_price` is the [`simulation`](../../develop/smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools#simulation) query.

        The query takes in an `offer_asset` which contains information about the native token and an amount to send.

        ```json 
        {
            "simulation": {
                "offer_asset": {
                    "info": {
                        "native_token": {
                            "denom": "uluna"
                        }
                    },
                    "amount": "100000"
                }
            }
        }
        ```      

        ---

        Normalizing Values

        Depending on the token decimal for the assets you are swapping, you may need to normalize the response from the `simulation` query before passing it into your `swap` message. 

        The code in this section is an example of using [feather.js](./tutorials-intro) to perform the `simulation` query, normalize the response, and store the results for later usage.

        ```js 
        const astrolunaAddress = "terra1udsua9w6jljwxwgwsegvt6v657rg3ayfvemupnes7lrggd28s0wq7g8azm";
        let beliefPrice;

        const simulation = await lcd.wasm.contractQuery(
        astrolunaAddress, 
        {
            "simulation": {
                "offer_asset": {
                    "info": {
                        "native_token": {
                            "denom": "uluna"
                        }
                    },
                    "amount": "100000"
                }
            }
        }
        ).then(result => { beliefPrice = result.return_amount });

        beliefPrice = String(beliefPrice * 1000000);
        ```

## CW20 Swap

Performs a CW20 swap in a given pool.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Scrollycoding>

        ### `Cw20HookMsg`

        To perform a CW20 swap, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the [`send`](https://docs.rs/cw20/latest/cw20/enum.Cw20ExecuteMsg.html#variant.Send) endpoint in the CW20 contract of the token you are swapping. 

        `send` includes the `contract` the tokens are being sent to (pair contract address), the `amount` to send/swap, and a binary encoded `msg` containing our contract call. 

        ```json
        {
            "send": {
                "contract": astrolunaAddress, 
                "amount": "1000000", 
                "msg": toBase64(
                    {
                        "swap": {
                            "ask_asset_info": {
                                "native_token": {
                                    "denom": "uluna"
                                }
                            }, 
                            "belief_price": beliefPrice, 
                            "max_spread": "0.005", 
                            "to": "..."
                        }
                    }
                )
            }
        }
        ```
        ---

        #### `swap` parameters

        Our swap message takes in our `ask_asset_info`, `belief_price`, `max_spread`, and the address tokens are being sent `to` (if diffent from the sender). 

        If `belief_price` is provided in combination with `max_spread`, the pool will check the difference between the return amount (using `belief_price`) and the real pool price. The `belief_price` +/- the `max_spread` creates a range of possible acceptable prices for this swap.


        ```json focus=6:16
        ```

        ---

        ### Encoding our `Msg`

        To encode our message, there are two common options: 

        - An online [base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/)
        - A custom function

        The code in this section uses a custom function (`toBase64`) to display our binary message - this function needs to be defined elsewhere to be used. The actual string representation of our message would be an encoded binary.

        ```json focus=5:18
        ```

        ---

        #### `toBase64` Encoder

        The code in this section is an example of what a `send` message may look like [feather.js](./tutorials-intro#featherjs) to define our custome function and encode our message. 

        ```js
        const toBase64 = (obj) => {
            return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)).toString("base64");
        };

        const cw20Swap = new MsgExecuteContract(
            wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
            astroAddress,
            {
                "send": {
                    "contract": astrolunaAddress, 
                    "amount": "1000000", 
                    "msg": toBase64(
                        {
                            "swap": {
                                "ask_asset_info": {
                                    "native_token": {
                                        "denom": "uluna"
                                    }
                                }, 
                                "belief_price": beliefPrice, 
                                "max_spread": "0.005"
                            }
                        }
                    )
                }
            }
        )
        ```

        ---

        ### Calculating the `belief_price`

        Lastly, calculating the `belief_price` for CW20 swaps is similar to doing so for native swaps. To learn more about this topic, refer to the section [above](#calculating-the-belief_price). 

        The exception is the `info` parameter in our [`simulation`](../../develop/smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools#simulation) query which is derived from an [`AssetInfo`](../smart-contracts/common-types#assetinfo) enum. For CW20 swaps, instead of using `native_token` and `denom`, use `token` and `contract_addr` .


        ```json 
        {
            "simulation": {
                "offer_asset": {
                    "info": {
                        "token": {
                            "contract_addr": astrolunaAddress
                        }
                    },
                    "amount": "1000000"
                }
            }
        }
        ```
