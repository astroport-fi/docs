# Request Astro Emissions

ASTRO is the native token of Astroport, forming an essential part of its rewards system. It works to amplify the incentives for liquidity providers, encouraging a diverse and robust ecosystem. To request ASTRO emissions for a pool, you will need to submit a governance proposal to the [Astral Assembly](../../../learn/astral-assembly) and obtain approval to move forward. 

<Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
    This section is specifically designed for developers who wish to request ASTRO emissions for a pool, without concerning themselves with third-party token emissions. If you're interested in Dual Rewards for your pool, look [here](../dual-rewards/dual-rewards-intro) instead. 
</Admonition>

In the following sections, we will guide you through the steps of crafting and submitting a governance proposals for Astro Emissions.Sections 1-3 dive into the heart of the governance proposal process. Sections 4-5 will guide you through crafting a proposal message dedicated to requesting ASTRO emissions. The final section will bring it all together, focusing on the formulation and submission of the combined proposal message.

<Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
  Astroport's governance hub is currently hosted on Terra. As such, for deployments on other blockchains (Neutron, Injective, and Sei), you will need to submit your governance proposal to the Assembly contract on Terra. Upon approval, this proposal will trigger a cross-chain governance operation, which executes the approved proposal on the specific blockchain to which the message was addressed.

## Steps

### 1. Construct `send` message

To initiate the submission of a proposal, a contract call needs to be executed that calls the [`send`](https://docs.rs/cw20/latest/cw20/enum.Cw20ExecuteMsg.html#variant.Send) endpoint within the [xASTRO token contract](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/xastro-token). The `send` operation requires three parameters:

- **`contract`:** This refers to the address where xASTRO tokens are being dispatched. In this context, it should be the Assembly address.
- **`amount`:** This specifies the quantity of xASTRO tokens to be sent or staked. For mainnet, it's currently 30,000 xASTRO (1000 xASTRO for testnet).
- **`msg`:** This is a binary-encoded message that contains a contract call to the `submit_proposal` endpoint. This message will be discussed below. 

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

        ```json focus=1:5,15:17
        {
          "send": {
            "contract": assemblyAddress, 
            "amount": "30000", 
            "msg": toBase64(
              {
                "submit_proposal": {
                  "title": "Integrate ASTRO emissions", 
                  "description": "Proposal to integrate ASTRO emissisons", 
                  "link": "https://forum.astroport.fi/", 
                  "messages": [setup_pools], 
                  "ibc_channel": "..."
                }
              }
            ) 
          }
        }
        ```

    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### 2. Construct `submit_proposal` message

The `msg` parameter in Step 1 requires a binary-encoded message, which essentially includes a contract call to the [`submit_proposal`](../../../develop/smart-contracts/astral-assembly#submit_proposal) endpoint within the Assembly contract. You will need to structure your `submit_proposal` message with the following parameters:

- **`title`**: This is the title of your proposal.
- **`description`**: This provides a more detailed explanation of your proposal. 
- **`link`**: This should be the URL to the forum discussion for your proposal.
- **`messages`**: This field includes your proposal messages for requesting ASTRO emissions. This message outline the changes to be made if your proposal is approved. The specific structure and content of these messages will be discussed in subsequent steps.
- **`ibc_channel`**: This field is reserved for proposals that should be executed on a different chain. If your proposal is meant to be executed cross-chain, specify the governance channel for the target chain.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

        ```json focus=5:15
        {
          "send": {
            "contract": assemblyAddress, 
            "amount": "30000", 
            "msg": toBase64(
              {
                "submit_proposal": {
                  "title": "Integrate ASTRO emissions", 
                  "description": "Proposal to integrate ASTRO emissisons", 
                  "link": "https://forum.astroport.fi/", 
                  "messages": [setup_pools], 
                  "ibc_channel": "..."
                }
              }
            ) 
          }
        }
        ```

    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### 3. Define an encoding function

Next, you'll need to encode the `submit_proposal` message you've constructed. As previously outlined in Step 1, the `msg` parameter requires a binary-encoded string. In Step 2, we prepped our `submit_proposal` message for encoding using a `toBase64` function. Now it's time to actually perform that encoding.

Please note that the `toBase64` function must be defined in your code environment to use it for encoding purposes. This function is crucial to convert the JSON string representation of our message into a base64 encoded string.

Here's an example of how to define the `toBase64` function in JavaScript:

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

        ```js
        let toBase64 = (obj) => {
          return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)).toString("base64");
        };
        ```
    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### 4. Constructing the `setup_pools` message

<Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
  In the scenario where you're executing a proposal via a script, it's advisable to compartmentalize each proposal message into distinct variables. These variables then get placed into the message vector of our proposal. This approach enhances the code modularity and maintainability.
</Admonition>

`setup_pools` is our first proposal message. It calls the [`setup_pools`](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#setup_pools) endpoint in the Generator contract and expects a parameter named `pools`. This parameter contains a vector of LP token addresses and their corresponding allocation points, which is also stored in a binary-encoded format using the toBase64 function we defined earlier.

It's crucial to avoid two common mistakes while working with the `setup_pools` function:

- The function expects LP token addresses, not pair addresses.
- The function expects a vector of LP token addresses. If a single address is specified, it overwrites all active pools with the new list. Therefore, you should query the generator contract to incorporate previous LP token addresses and allocation points. This step will be discussed next. 

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

      ```js
      let setup_pools = {
        {
          "wasm": {
            "execute": {
              "contract_addr": generatorAddress, 
              "msg": toBase64(
                {
                  "setup_pools": {
                    "pools": config.active_pools
                  }
                }
              ),
              "funds": []
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### 5. Query `config.active_pools`

The previous step presented the `setup_pools` proposal message, calling the [`setup_pools`](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#setup_pools) endpoint in the Generator contract. This message carries an array of liquidity pool tokens and their associated allocation points.

**When you specify a single liquidity pool token address in the setup_pools message, it replaces all active pools with the one specified in the message.** To preserve existing pools while introducing new ones, you need to query the [Generator contract](../../../develop/smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator) to fetch the currently active pool addresses and their allocation points.

The code snippet below demonstrates this process. It begins by querying the Generator contract to obtain its current configuration. It then appends a new liquidity pool token address and allocation points to the `active_pools` list. This updated list will then be utilized in our `setup_pools` proposal message.

<Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
  In cases where the community desires to reduce allocation points for specific pools, proposal submitters may need to modify the `config.active_pools` list accordingly.
</Admonition>

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>

      ```js
      let config;

      const query = await lcd.wasm.contractQuery(
        generatorAddress, 
        {
          "config": {}
        }
      ).then(result => { config = result });

      config.active_pools.push("new_lp_token", "new_alloc_points")
      ```

    </CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### 6. Complete proposal

This section brings all the individual pieces together to form our complete proposal submission. This involves organizing our proposal messages and executing the final `submit_proposal` call.

<Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
This example does not include the initial Terra LCD setup. To learn more, visit the [feather.js docs](https://docs.terra.money/develop/feather-js/). 

Additionally, make sure to adjust all placeholders (e.g., `generatorAddress`, `new_lp_token`, `new_alloc_points`) to your specific use case.

                    "pools": config.active_pools
                  }
                }
              ),
              "funds": []
            }
          }
        }
      }

      // send tx

      const integrateDualRewards = new MsgExecuteContract(
        wallet.key.accAddress('terra'), 
        xastroAddress, 
        {
          "send": {
            "contract": assemblyAddress, 
            "amount": "30000", 
            "msg": toBase64(
              {
                "submit_proposal": {
                  "title": "Integrate ASTRO emissions", 
                  "description": "Proposal to integrate ASTRO emissions", 
                  "link": "https://forum.astroport.fi/", 
                  "messages": [setup_pools], 
                  "ibc_channel": "..."
                }
              }
            ) 
          }
        }
      )

      // broadcast tx

      let fee = new Fee(2000000, { uluna: 100000 });

      let tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({
        msgs: [integrateDualRewards],
        fee,
        chainID: 'phoenix-1',
      });

      let result = await lcd.tx.broadcast(tx, 'phoenix-1');

      console.log(result);
      ```
