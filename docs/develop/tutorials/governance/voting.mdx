# Voting

## Overview

If you have staked ASTRO into the [`Staking`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/staking) contract, you may be eligible to vote on proposals. Staking must have occured before the submission of the proposal you are voting on. 

Additionally, proposal submitters cannot vote on their own proposal. 

## Casting a Vote

        ### `cast_vote`

        To vote on a proposal, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the [`cast_vote`](../../smart-contracts/astral-assembly#cast_vote) endpoint in the [`Assembly`](../../smart-contracts/astral-assembly) contract. 

        `cast_vote` takes in the `proposal_id` and the `vote` option (`for` or `against`)

        ```json
        {
            "cast_vote": {
                "proposal_id": 92,
                "vote": "for"
            }
        }
        ```

        ### feather.js example

        The code in this section is an example implementation of a `cast_vote` message using feather.js.

        ```js
        const assemblyAddress = 'terra195m6n5xq4rkjy47fn5y3s08tfmj3ryknj55jqvgq2y55zul9myzsgy06hk';

        const vote = new MsgExecuteContract(
            wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
            assemblyAddress,
            {
                "cast_vote": {
                    "proposal_id": 92,
                    "vote": "for"
                }
            }
        )

        let fee = new Fee(2000000, { uluna: 100000 });

        let tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({
            msgs: [vote],
            fee,
            chainID: 'pisco-1',
        });

        let result = await lcd.tx.broadcast(tx, 'pisco-1');

        console.log(result);
        ```
