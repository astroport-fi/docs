# Staking/Unstaking ASTRO-xASTRO

## Overview 

A user can stake their ASTRO tokens into the [`Staking`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/staking) contract in exchange for xASTRO. by calling the [`enter`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/staking#enter) endpoint in the Staking contract. The `enter` operation should be executed from inside the ASTRO contract.

Users can unstake their xASTRO tokens by calling [`leave`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/staking#leave) endpoint in the Staking contract. `leave` claims the initial staked amount + accrued ASTRO since staking.

## Staking ASTRO

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Scrollycoding>

        ### `Cw20HookMsg`

        To stake our ASTRO tokens, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the [`send`](https://docs.rs/cw20/latest/cw20/enum.Cw20ExecuteMsg.html#variant.Send) enpoint in the [ASTRO `token` contract](../../smart-contracts/token).

        The send operation takes in a:

        - `contract` - Address where ASTRO tokens are being sent to (Staking contract)
        - `amount` - Amount to send/stake
        - `msg` - Binary encoded message containing our contract call.

        ```json
        {
            "send": {
                "contract": stakingAddress, 
                "amount": "100000000", 
                "msg": toBase64(
                    {
                        "enter": {}
                    }
                )
            }
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### `enter`

        Our encoded message performs a contract call to the [`enter`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/staking#enter) endpoint in the Staking contract.

        Deposits ASTRO in the xASTRO staking contract.

        No additional parameters are required.

        ```json focus=6:8
        ```

        ---

        ### Encoding our `Msg`

        To encode our message, there are two common options:

        - An [online base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/)
        - A custom function

        The code in this section uses a custom function (`toBase64`) to display our binary message - this function needs to be defined elsewhere to be used. The actual string representation of our message would be an encoded binary.

        ```json focus=5:9
        ```

        ---

        #### `toBase64`

        The code in this section is an example of an [`enter`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/staking#enter) message using [feather.js](../network/terra-2#featherjs) to define our custom function and encode our message.

        ```js
        const astroAddress = 'terra167dsqkh2alurx997wmycw9ydkyu54gyswe3ygmrs4lwume3vmwks8ruqnv';
        const stakingAddress = 'terra19t8ffmz6q2rdm3rllyksd6sex6n650a4anttzzvz9mf8mqr4nkrq44cyu6';

        const stake = new MsgExecuteContract(
            wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
            astroAddress,
            {
                "send": {
                    "contract": stakingAddress, 
                    "amount": "100000000", 
                    "msg": toBase64(
                        {
                            "enter": {}
                        }
                    )
                }
            }
        )
        ```

## Unstaking xASTRO

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Scrollycoding>

        ### `Cw20HookMsg`


        To unstake our xASTRO tokens, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the [`send`](https://docs.rs/cw20/latest/cw20/enum.Cw20ExecuteMsg.html#variant.Send) enpoint in the [xASTRO `token` contract](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/xastro-token).

        The send operation takes in a:

        - `contract` - Address where xASTRO tokens are being withdrawn from to (Staking contract)
        - `amount` - Amount to send (unstake)
        - `msg` - Binary encoded message containing our contract call.
        
        ```json
        {
            "send": {
                "contract": stakingAddress, 
                "amount": "50000000", 
                "msg": toBase64(
                    {
                        "leave": {}
                    }
                )
            }
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### `leave`

        Our encoded message performs a contract call to the [`leave`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/staking#leave) endpoint in the Staking contract.

        This burns xASTRO and unstakes underlying ASTRO (initial staked amount + accrued ASTRO since staking).

        No additional parameters are required.

        ```json focus=6:8
        ```

        ---

        ### Encoding our `Msg`

        The same logic for encoding messages is used to enter and leave the staking contract. Refer to the section [above](#encoding-our-msg) for more information on this topic.  

        ```json focus=5:9
        ```
