# Staking/Unstaking LP Tokens

## Overview

A user can stake their LP tokens into the Generator contract to receive ASTRO or 3rd party emissions by calling [`deposit`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#deposit). The `deposit` operation should be executed from inside the contract of the LP token you want to stake.

Users can also unstake their LP tokens by calling [`withdraw`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#withdraw) endpoint in the Generator contract. `withdraw` also claims any outstanding token emissions.

        ### `send`

        To stake our LP tokens in the Generator contract, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the `send` enpoint of the contract associated with the LP token you want to stake.

        The `send` operation takes in a: 

        - `contract` - Address LP tokens are being sent to (Generator contract) 
        - `amount` - Amount to send/stake 
        - `msg` - Binary encoded message containing our contract call.

        ```json
        {
          "send": {
            "contract": generatorAddress,
            "amount": "10000000",
            "msg": toBase64(
              {
                  "deposit": {}
              }
            )
          }
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### `deposit`

        Our encoded message performs a contract call to the [`deposit`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#deposit) endpoint in the Generator contract. 

        No other parameters are required.


        ```json focus=6:8
        ```

        ---

        ### Encoding our `Msg`


        To encode our message, there are two common options:

        - An [online base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/)
        - A custom function

        The code in this section uses a custom function (toBase64) to display our binary message - this function needs to be defined elsewhere to be used. The actual string representation of our message would be an encoded binary.

        ```json focus=5:9
        ```
        --- 

        #### `toBase64`

        The code in this section is an example of a `deposit` message using [feather.js](../network/terra-2#featherjs) to define our custom function and encode our message.

        ```js
        const generatorAddress = 'terra1gc4d4v82vjgkz0ag28lrmlxx3tf6sq69tmaujjpe7jwmnqakkx0qm28j2l';

        const stakeLPTokens = new MsgExecuteContract(
          wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
          astrolunaLPAddress,
          {
            "send": {
              "contract": generatorAddress,
              "amount": "10000000",
              "msg": toBase64(
                {
                  "deposit": {}
                }
              )
            }
          }
        )

        const fee = new Fee(2000000, { uluna: 200000 });

        const tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({
          msgs: [stakeLPTokens],
          fee,
          chainID: 'pisco-1',
        });

        const result = await lcd.tx.broadcast(tx, 'pisco-1');

        console.log(result);
        ```

## Unstaking LP Tokens

        ### `withdraw`

        To unstake LP tokens from the Generator contract, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the [`withdraw`](../../smart-contracts/tokenomics/generator#withdraw) endpoing in the Generator contract. 

        `withdraw` takes in the address `lp_token` you want to withdraw and an `amount` to withdraw. 

        ```json
        {
          "withdraw": {
            "lp_token": astrolunaLPAddress,
            "amount": "5000000"
          }
        }
        ```
