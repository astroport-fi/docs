# Providing/Withdrawing Liquidity

## Overview 

A user can provide liquidity to a pool by calling `provide_liquidity`. Before executing the `provide_liqudity` operation, a user must allow the pool contract to take tokens from their wallet for all CW20 tokens in a given pair.

Users can also withdraw liquidity by calling `withdraw_liquidity`. To receive the underlying liquidity back plus accrued LP fees, LPs must burn their liquidity tokens.

## Providing Liquidity

        ### `increase_allowance`

        Before we can provide liquidity to a pool, we need to increase the token allowance for all CW20 tokens in the pair.

        The [`increase_allowance`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/cw20/README.md#messages-1) endpoint for a given CW20 token contract contains:
        
        - A `spender` (the pair address we are depositing to in our example)
        - The `amount` to increase the allowance by
        - An optional expiration time

        ```json
        {
            "increase_allowance": {
                "spender": astrolunaAddress,
                "amount": "1000000000000",
                "expires": {
                    "never": {}
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### `provide_liquidity`

        To provide liquidity, you need to execute a contract message pointing to the [`provide_liquidity`](../../smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools#provide_liquidity) endpoint in the [`pair`](../../smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools) contract for the selected pool. 

        `assets` is the only required parameter and contains information about each token in the pair, including the contract address or native denomination and the amount to deposit. 

        For new pools, you can deposit any ratio of tokens in a pair. For existing pairs, the contract will throw an error message if the proper balance of ratios between tokens is not met.

        ```json
        {
            "provide_liquidity": {
                "assets": [
                    {
                        "info": {
                            "token": {
                                "contract_addr": astroAddress
                            }
                        },
                        "amount": beliefPrice
                    },
                    {
                        "info": {
                            "native_token": {
                                "denom": "uluna"
                            }
                        },
                        "amount": "500000"
                    }
                ],
                "slippage_tolerance": "0.005",
                "auto_stake": false, 
                "receiver": "..."
            }
        }
        ```

        ---

        #### Optional Parameters

        `provide_liqudity` takes up the following optional parameters: 

        - `slippage_tolerance`: Allows liquidity provision while the price of assets in a pool stays within a certain range
        - `auto_stake`: Determines whether the LP tokens minted for the user are auto staked in the Generator contract.
        - `receiver`: The receiver of LP tokens (if different from sender)



        ```json focus=21:23
        ```

        ---

        #### `Coins`

        If the pair you are providing liquidity to contains a native asset, you will also need to send the native token along with the transaction message. 

        The code in this section is an example of what a `provide_liquidity` message may look like using feather.js to send Coins with our transaction.

        ```js
        const astroAddress = 'terra167dsqkh2alurx997wmycw9ydkyu54gyswe3ygmrs4lwume3vmwks8ruqnv';

        const provideLiquidity = new MsgExecuteContract(
            wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
            astrolunaAddress,
            {
                "provide_liquidity": {
                    "assets": [
                        {
                            "info": {
                                "token": {
                                    "contract_addr": astroAddress
                                }
                            },
                            "amount": beliefPrice
                        },
                        {
                            "info": {
                                "native_token": {
                                    "denom": "uluna"
                                }
                            },
                            "amount": "500000"
                        }
                    ],
                    "slippage_tolerance": "0.005",
                    "auto_stake": false
                }
            }, 
            new Coins({ "uluna": "500000" })
        );


        const fee = new Fee(2000000, { uluna: 200000 });

        const tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({
        msgs: [provideLiquidity],
        fee,
        chainID: 'pisco-1',
        });

        const result = await lcd.tx.broadcast(tx, 'pisco-1');

        console.log(result);
        ```

        ---

        ### Calculating Deposit Amount

        As noted above, the contract will throw an error message if the proper balance of ratios between tokens is not met.

        In order to obtain the ratio of tokens that we need, we can simulate a swap and input our response as the `amount` for one of our deposits. 

        ```json
        {
            "provide_liquidity": {
                "assets": [
                    {
                        "info": {
                            "token": {
                                "contract_addr": astroAddress
                            }
                        },
                        "amount": beliefPrice
                    },
                    {
                        "info": {
                            "native_token": {
                                "denom": "uluna"
                            }
                        },
                        "amount": "500000"
                    }
                ],
                "slippage_tolerance": "0.005",
                "auto_stake": false
            }
        }
        ```

        ---

        #### `simulation`

        The [`simulation`](../../smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools#simulation) endpoint contains information about our offer asset and the amount to swap. 

        Our input `amount` and response will gives us the proper ratio of tokens that we need to `provide_liquidity`. 

        ```json
        {
            "simulation": {
                "offer_asset": {
                    "info": {
                        "native_token": {
                            "denom": "uluna"
                        }
                    },
                    "amount": "500000"
                }
            }
        }
        ```

## Withdrawing Liquidity 

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Scrollycoding>

        ### `withdraw_liquidity`

        To [`withdraw_liquidity`](../../smart-contracts/swap-pairs/constant-product-pools#withdraw_liquidity), you need to execute a contract message pointing to the `send` endpoint in the CW20 contract of the LP token associated with the pair. 

        send includes the contract the tokens are being sent to (pair contract address), the amount to send (withdraw), and a binary encoded msg containing our contract call (`withdraw: {}`).

        ```json
        {
            "send": {
                "contract": astrolunaAddress,
                "amount": "10000000",
                "msg": toBase64(
                    {
                        "withdraw_liquidity": {}
                    }
                )
            }
        }
        ```
        ---

        ### Encoding our `Msg`

        To encode our message, there are two common options:

        - An [online base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/)
        - A custom function

        The code in this section uses a custom function (`toBase64`) to display our binary message - this function needs to be defined elsewhere to be used. The actual string representation of our message would be an encoded binary.

        ```json focus=5:9
        ```

        ---

        #### `toBase64`

        The code in this section is an example of a `withdraw_liquidity` message using [feather.js](../tutorials-intro#featherjs) to define our custom function and encode our message.

        ```js
        const astrolunaAddress = 'terra1udsua9w6jljwxwgwsegvt6v657rg3ayfvemupnes7lrggd28s0wq7g8azm';
        const astrolunaLPAddress = 'terra1886vn036tc9e7ejx8pe4nkhts3gwpdfegwc4n3u77n0q76fjdthqarl8uc';
        
        const toBase64 = (obj) => {
            return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)).toString("base64");
        };

        const withdraw = new MsgExecuteContract(
            wallet.key.accAddress('terra'),
            astrolunaLPAddress,
            {
                "send": {
                    "contract": astrolunaAddress,
                    "amount": "10000000",
                    "msg": toBase64(
                        {
                            "withdraw_liquidity": {}
                        }
                    )
                }
            }
        )

        const fee = new Fee(2000000, { uluna: 200000 });

        // // BROADCAST TRANSACTION
        const tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({
        msgs: [withdraw],
        fee,
        chainID: 'pisco-1',
        });

        const result = await lcd.tx.broadcast(tx, 'pisco-1');

        console.log(result);
        ```
