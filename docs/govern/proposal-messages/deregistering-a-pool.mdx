# Deregistering a Pool

## Overview

A specific pair (e.g ASTRO/axlUSDC) cannot have both a stableswap and a xyk pool at the same time. If someone creates a xyk for a specific token pair, Astroport governance will have to `deregister` the pool if the intent was to use stableswap instead. The same principle applies if someone created an invalid stableswap pool and liquidity should go to an xyk pool instead. In short, an xyk pool should not be upgraded to a stableswap pool or vice-versa.

## Using the Astroport Web App

Use when submitting a proposal to `deregister` a pool through the Astroport Web App. This tutorial walks you through the `Executable Messages` field of the proposal.

        ### `Vec<ProposalMessage>`

        The Executable Messages field in our proposal takes in a vector containing objects of type [`ProposalMessage`](../../develop/smart-contracts/astral-assembly#proposalmessage). Each `ProposalMessage` requires the following parameters: 

        - `order`: The order of execution of the message
        - `msg`: Execution message of type [`CosmosMsg`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.CosmosMsg.html)

        ```json
        [
          {
              "order": "1",
              "msg": {
                "wasm": {
                  "execute": {
                    "contract_addr": factoryAddress,
                    "msg": toBase64(
                      {
                        "deregister": {
                          "asset_infos": [
                            {
                              "token": {
                                "contract_addr": astroAddress
                              }
                            },
                            {
                              "token": {
                                "contract_addr": steakAddress
                              }
                            }
                          ]
                        }
                      }
                    ),
                    "funds": []
                  }
                }
              }
          }
        ]
        ```

        ---

        #### `wasm`

        `CosmosMsg` is an enum that supports various types of messages. To deregister a pool, our `CosmosMsg` must be of type [`wasm`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.WasmMsg.html). Furthermore, our `wasm` message must be of type [`execute`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.WasmMsg.html#variant.Execute). In the backgrund, we are creating a wasm contract call to the [`submit_proposal`](../../develop/smart-contracts/astral-assembly#submit_proposal) endpoint in the [`Assembly`](../../develop/smart-contracts/astral-assembly) contract. 

        ```json focus=5:28
        ```

        ---

        #### `execute`

        The `execute` operation requires the following parameters: 

        - `contract_addr`: Address of the contract where the execute message is being sent to. For deregistering a pool, this would be the [`Factory`](../../develop/smart-contracts/factory) contract. 
        - `msg`: A binary encoded message containing our contract call. 
        - `funds`: Any funds to send along with our transaction.

        <Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
        This tutorial uses placeholder variables for contract addresses. Use the actual string representation of each contract address when submitting a proposal. 
        </Admonition>

        ```json focus=6:27
        ```
        ---

        #### `msg`

        The code in this section uses a custom function (`toBase64`) to display our binary message - this function needs to be defined elsewhere to be used and is **not accessible** within the Astroport Web App. 
        
        **Use for demonstration purposes only.** The actual string representation of our message will be an encoded binary, which will be covered below.

        ```json focus=8:25
        ```

        ---

        ### `deregister`

        To `deregister` a pool, our proposal `msg` must point to the [`deregister`](../../develop/smart-contracts/factory#deregister) endpoint in the [`Factory`](../../develop/smart-contracts/factory) contract. 

        `deregister` takes in the address or native denomination of each token for the pool being deregistered stored in a vector of type [`AssetInfo`](../../develop/smart-contracts/common-types#assetinfo). 

        ```json
        {
          "deregister": {
            "asset_infos": [
              {
                "token": {
                  "contract_addr": astroAddress
                }
              },
              {
                "token": {
                  "contract_addr": steakAddress
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### Encoding our `deregister` `msg`

        Our `deregister` message needs to be encoded and and passed as an input into our `msg` parameter within our `execute` call. 
        
        Since we are using the Astroport Web App to submit our proposal, we will encode our message manually using an [online Base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/). 

        Make sure to replace the substitute variables with contract addresses before encoding your message. 

        ---

        #### Final result

        Once we encode our message, our final Executable Message that we would submit to the Astroport Web App to deregister a pool ends up looking something like the code in this section. 

        You can see our contract call to the `deregister` endpoint by decoding our `msg` using a [Base64 decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/). 

        ```json
        [
          {
            "order": "1",
            "msg": {
              "wasm": {
                "execute": {
                  "contract_addr": "terra1z3y69xas85r7egusa0c7m5sam0yk97gsztqmh8f2cc6rr4s4anysudp7k0", // factoryAddress
                  "msg": "ewogICJkZXJlZ2lzdGVyIjogewogICAgImFzc2V0X2luZm9zIjogWwogICAgICB7CiAgICAgICAgInRva2VuIjogewogICAgICAgICAgImNvbnRyYWN0X2FkZHIiOiAidGVycmExNjdkc3FraDJhbHVyeDk5N3dteWN3OXlka3l1NTRneXN3ZTN5Z21yczRsd3VtZTN2bXdrczhydXFudiIKICAgICAgICB9CiAgICAgIH0sCiAgICAgIHsKICAgICAgICAidG9rZW4iOiB7CiAgICAgICAgICAiY29udHJhY3RfYWRkciI6ICJ0ZXJyYTF4enRueDhtbTdkYWduNGNrM2RneWxhcXVjcDZoNmFndzgzcG15YzI5aG5wbHE3MzU1dHJzNzhma2NxIgogICAgICAgIH0KICAgICAgfQogICAgXQogIH0KfQ==",

                }
              }
            }
          }
        ]
        ```

## Submitting a Proposal Directly

An advantage of submitting a proposal directly using, for example, a js script is that you could encode your message automatically using a custom function. However, some additional steps are required to submit a proposal. 

Before continuing with this section, make sure to read the section above on submitting a proposal through the Astroport Web App. The Astroport Web App essentially wraps our executable message (covered above) within a [`submit_proposal`](../../develop/smart-contracts/astral-assembly#submit_proposal) message to the [`Assembly`](../../develop/smart-contracts/astral-assembly) contract. This section will focus on completing this last step. 


<CH.Section>

        ### `send`

        To submit a proposal, you need to execute a contract call pointing to the [`send`](https://docs.rs/cw20/latest/cw20/enum.Cw20ExecuteMsg.html#variant.Send) endpoint in the xASTRO token contract. 

        The send operation takes in a:

        - `contract` - Address where xASTRO tokens are being sent to (Assembly address)
        - `amount` - Amount to send/stake (30,000 xASTRO for mainnet)
        - `msg` - Binary encoded message containing our contract call to `submit_proposal`

        ```json
        {
          "send": {
            "contract": assemblyAddress, 
            "amount": "1000", // testnet deposit amount
            "msg": toBase64(
              {
                "submit_proposal": {
                  "title": "deregister astro-steak pair", 
                  "description": "proposal to deregister inactive pair", 
                  "link": "https://forum.astroport.fi/t/arc-37-update-deployed-stableswaps-to-latest-pool-version/927", 
                  "messages": [
                    {
                      "order": "1",
                      "msg": {
                        "wasm": {
                          "execute": {
                            "contract_addr": factoryAddress,
                            "msg": "ewogICJkZXJlZ2lzdGVyIjogewogICAgImFzc2V0X2luZm9zIjogWwogICAgICB7CiAgICAgICAgInRva2VuIjogewogICAgICAgICAgImNvbnRyYWN0X2FkZHIiOiAidGVycmExNjdkc3FraDJhbHVyeDk5N3dteWN3OXlka3l1NTRneXN3ZTN5Z21yczRsd3VtZTN2bXdrczhydXFudiIKICAgICAgICB9CiAgICAgIH0sCiAgICAgIHsKICAgICAgICAidG9rZW4iOiB7CiAgICAgICAgICAiY29udHJhY3RfYWRkciI6ICJ0ZXJyYTF4enRueDhtbTdkYWduNGNrM2RneWxhcXVjcDZoNmFndzgzcG15YzI5aG5wbHE3MzU1dHJzNzhma2NxIgogICAgICAgIH0KICAgICAgfQogICAgXQogIH0KfQ",

                          }
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  ]
                }
              }
            )
          }
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### `submit_proposal`

        Our encoded message performs a contract call to the [`submit_proposal`](../../develop/smart-contracts/astral-assembly#submit_proposal) endpoint in the [`Assembly`](../../develop/smart-contracts/astral-assembly) contract.

        `submit_proposal` takes in the following parameters:

        - `title`: Proposal title
        - `description`: Description for the proposal
        - `link`: Link to forum discussion
        - `messages`: Proposal message containing our binary contract call to `deregister`

        All further steps to the `messages` parameter can be found [above](#using-the-astroport-web-app). 

        ```json focus=6:26

        ```

        ---

        ### Encoding our `submit_proposal` `msg`

        Finally, our `submit_proposal` message needs to be encoded and passed as an input into our msg parameter within our `send` call.

        ```json focus=5:27
        ```

        ---

        #### `toBase64`

       The code in this section uses a custom function (`toBase64`) to display our binary message - this function needs to be defined elsewhere to be used. The actual string representation of our message would be an encoded binary, similar to our `deregister` message.

        ```js
        let toBase64 = (obj) => {
          return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)).toString("base64");
        };
        ```
